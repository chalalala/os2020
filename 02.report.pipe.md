# Practical Work 2: Pipe and I/O Redirection

- List all files in current directory containing «list» in theirnames (filter with `grep`)
	``` 
    ~$ ls | grep "list"
	```

    **Output:** 
    ```
	filelist  
	listfile.txt
    ```
    
- Count how many lines that `/etc/passwd` has (use `wc`)
	```
    ~$ wc -l /etc/passwd
	```
    
    **Output:**
	```
    41 /etc/passwd
	```
    
- Check how much memory that your machine has, not free memory (use `free`)
	```
	~$ free | awk '{$3="";print}'| head -2
	```
	
    **Output:**
   	```
	total used  shared buff/cache available  
	Mem: 2035488  252676 83180 367444 391568
	```
	
- Find how many logical core that your CPU has (see `/proc/cpuinfo`)
	```
    ~$ grep -w "cores" /proc/cpuinfo
	```
    
    **Output:**
	```
    cpu cores	: 1
	```
	
 - Count how many .jpg files that you have in your photo directory (use `find`)
    ```
    ~$ find ./Pictures -name *.jpg | wc -l
    ```
    
    **Output:**

    3
    ```
